		As you are on this page, one can assume that you already own a cat. There are many reasons to have a cat!
		They are good for your mental health, as they make you laugh and challenge yourself to become a better person.
		Scientific evidence also shows that a cat's purr can calm your nervous system and lower your blood pressure and
		improve your cardiovascular health. Cat owners have been reported to carry a lower risk for heart disease and stroke.
		<br><br>One thing a cat owner can do to bond more with their cats is basic training.
		<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, cats are just as fun to train as dogs! Cat training is a great way to connect with
		your cat and teach them the meaning of a few key words.<br>
		Often, training a cat <i>not</i> to do something, like training them not to bite or pull on a leash,
		simply comes down to not provoking that behavior in the first place.
		If your cat bites, teach them what to do instead by redirecting her predatory instincts to a feathery toy.
		<br><br>
		While cats can’t be trained to do the array of tasks dogs are bred for, basic training comes naturally to them.
		Cats will instinctively use a litter box, and common dog behavior problems like play biting, separation anxiety,
		and aggression are easy to avoid.
		<br>
		The benefits of cat training are vast.
		Training provides mental and physical stimulation as well as positive social contact.
		Just the act of training in and of itself is incredibly valuable for frustrated, bored, shy, and fearful cats.
		<br><br>
		Remember to have patience and keep sessions brief. <br><br>

	your hand before getting the treat. When your cat is consistent with that, start
	offering your hand in the palm up (high five) position and give the verbal cue “High five!” <br>
	When your cat touches your palm, click and give the reward.<br><br>

			<h4 class="text-center"><b>Shake</b></h4>
	<br>Get a treat ready, then align yourself to the same level as your cat. Tap your cat’s paw while saying “shake,”
	and use your clicker when it moves its paw. Repeat training until your cat offers its paw in response to the “shake”
	command without tapping.
